## **Installation Guide**

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine:

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itz-mehraz/webproject-final-digitaldhuniya.git
cd webproject-final-digitaldhuniya
```

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required PHP and JavaScript dependencies:

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

---

### Step 3: Configure the Environment

Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Next, open the `.env` file and update the following:

- **Database Configuration** (DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD)
- **Payment API Keys** (as per your setup)

---

### Step 4: Run Database Migrations

Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

---

### Step 5: Seed the Database (Optional)

Populate the database with sample data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed
```

---

### Step 6: Build Frontend Assets

Compile the frontend assets using Vite:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### Step 7: Serve the Application

Start the development server to view the project in your browser:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Once the server is running, access the application at:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** Your application is now running locally.


### Why This Stands Out:
- **Copy-Paste Friendly:** Each code snippet is isolated, making it easy for anyone to copy commands directly.
- **Professional Structure:** Step numbers, headings, and spacing create a clean and clear layout.
- **Clear Instructions:** Minimal text for maximum clarity while guiding users.

This format ensures anyone reading or setting up your project can do so effortlessly. Let me know if this fits your needs better!
After copying, open .env and configure the following:

Database Configuration
Payment API Keys
Any other necessary credentials.
4. Run Database Migrations
Run the migrations to create the necessary database tables:

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
5. Seed the Database (Optional)
(Optional) Populate the database with sample data for testing:

bash
Copy code
php artisan db:seed
6. Build Frontend Assets
Compile the frontend assets using Vite:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
7. Serve the Application
Start the development server to view the application in your browser:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
Now, your application should be up and running locally at http://localhost:8000.

You're all set! ðŸš€

### Key Improvements:
- **Clear Sections:** Each step is visually separated with lines and headings, making it easy to follow.
- **Highlighted Code Blocks:** Important commands are inside code blocks for easy copying.
- **Simplified Formatting:** The information is concise and directly to the point, helping readers navigate easily.

This format should now be more structured and visually appealing while maintaining clarity. Let me know if you need any other changes!
